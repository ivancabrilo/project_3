          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Inglourious Basterds is a 2009 war film[8] written and directed by
            Quentin Tarantino, starring Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Michael
            Fassbender, Eli Roth, Diane Kruger, Daniel Brühl, Til Schweiger and
            Mélanie Laurent. The film tells an alternate history story of two
            plots to assassinate Nazi Germany's leadership—one planned by
            Shosanna Dreyfus, a young French Jewish cinema proprietor, and the
            other planned by the British but ultimately conducted solely by a
            team of Jewish American soldiers led by First Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
            Christoph Waltz co-stars as Hans Landa, an SS colonel in charge of
            tracking down Raine's group. The title was inspired by Italian
            director Enzo G. Castellari's 1978 Euro War film The Inglorious
            Bastards, though Tarantino's film is not a remake of it.

          <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
          <p>
            In 1941, SS-Standartenführer Hans Landa interrogates French farmer
            Perrier LaPadite, suspecting that the LaPadites are hiding a Jewish
            family, the Dreyfuses, under their floorboards. LaPadite confirms
            this to spare his own family, and Landa has the hidden family shot,
            but allows Shosanna Dreyfus to escape.[9] Three years later, U.S.
            Army Lieutenant Aldo Raine recruits Jewish-American soldiers to the
            "Basterds", a black ops commando unit instilling fear among Nazis in
            occupied France by killing and scalping them. The group includes
            Sergeant Donny "The Bear Jew" Donowitz, rogue German Sergeant Hugo
            Stiglitz, and Austrian-born translator Corporal Wilhelm Wicki. In
            Germany, Adolf Hitler interviews a German soldier, who reveals that
            Raine carved a swastika into his forehead after massacring his
            squad. In Paris, Shosanna operates a cinema under the name
            Emmanuelle Mimieux, and meets Fredrick Zoller, a famed German sniper
            set to star in the Nazi propaganda film Stolz der Nation (Nation's
            Pride). Infatuated with Shosanna, Zoller convinces Joseph Goebbels
            to hold the film's premiere at her cinema. Landa, the premiere's
            head of security, interrogates Shosanna but does not reveal if he
            recognizes her. She plots with her Afro-French lover and
            projectionist, Marcel, to kill the Nazi leaders in attendance.
            British Commando Lieutenant Archie Hicox is recruited to lead an
            attack on the premiere with the Basterds. Disguised as German
            officers, Hicox, Stiglitz, and Wicki meet with German film star
            Bridget von Hammersmark, an undercover Allied agent, at a tavern in
            Nazi-occupied northern France. Hicox inadvertently draws the
            attention of Wehrmacht Sergeant Wilhelm and Major Dieter Hellström,
            first with his unusually accented German and then by using a British
            hand gesture. Their cover is blown, and a gunfight ensues, killing
            everyone except Wilhelm and a wounded von Hammersmark. Raine arrives
            and negotiates for von Hammersmark's release, but she shoots
            Wilhelm. Raine tortures von Hammersmark, believing she set his men
            up, but she convinces him she is loyal and reveals Hitler will be
            attending the premiere. Raine decides to carry out their plan with
            himself, Donowitz, and Omar Ulmer. Investigating the tavern, Landa
            finds von Hammersmark's shoe and a napkin with her signature. Raine,
            Donowitz, and Ulmer infiltrate the premiere with timed explosives,
            while Landa confronts von Hammersmark with her missing shoe before
            strangling her to death. Raine and another Basterd, Smithson
            Utivich, are discovered and taken prisoner, but Landa has Raine
            contact his superior to cut a deal: Landa will allow the mission to
            proceed in exchange for safe passage through the Allied lines, a
            full pardon, and other privileges. During the screening, Zoller
            slips away to the projection booth and berates Shosanna for
            rejecting his advances, leading them to shoot each other dead. As
            the film reaches its climax, Shosanna's spliced-in footage tells the
            audience that they are about to be killed by a Jew. Having locked
            the auditorium, Marcel ignites a pile of flammable film behind the
            screen, setting the theater ablaze. Ulmer and Donowitz break into
            the opera box, gunning down Hitler and Goebbels and firing into the
            crowd until their explosives kill everyone inside the cinema,
            including themselves. Landa and his radio operator drive Raine and
            Utivich into Allied territory, where they surrender themselves.
            However, Raine shoots the radio operator before ordering Utivich to
            scalp him, and carves a swastika into Landa's forehead, professing
            it to be his "masterpiece". Inglourious Basterds weaves multiple
            storylines together. Lt. Aldo Raine and his Basterds embark on a
            mission to kill and terrorize Nazis in German-occupied France.
            Simultaneously, Shosanna Dreyfus seeks revenge against the Nazis for
            her family's murder. The film builds towards a climactic event at a
            movie premiere, where characters' paths intersect in unexpected
            ways, leading to a thrilling and explosive finale.
