            DiCaprio stars as Deputy U.S. Marshal Edward "Teddy" Daniels, who is
            investigating a psychiatric facility on Shutter Island after one of
            the patients goes missing. Mark Ruffalo plays his partner and fellow

          <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
          <p>
            In 1954, U.S. Marshal Edward "Teddy" Daniels and his new partner
            Chuck Aule travel to Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane
            on Shutter Island, Boston Harbor, to investigate the disappearance
            of Rachel Solando, a patient of the hospital who had previously
            drowned her three children. The staff, led by psychiatrist Dr. John
            Cawley, appear uncooperative. The marshals learn that Dr. Lester
            Sheehan, who was treating Solando, had left the island on vacation
            immediately after Solando disappeared. Teddy experiences migraine
            headaches, flashbacks of his experiences as a U.S. Army soldier
            during the liberation of Dachau, and also vivid dreams of his wife
            Dolores, who was killed in a fire set by arsonist Andrew Laeddis.
            Teddy explains to Chuck that he took the case to find Laeddis,
            believing he is on the island. Solando suddenly resurfaces and
            believes Teddy is her husband. Teddy later breaks into the
            restricted Ward C to find Laeddis where he meets patient George
            Noyce who appears to know him well. He tells Teddy that the doctors
            are experimenting on patients, some of whom are taken to a
            lighthouse to be lobotomized. He warns Teddy that everyone is
            deceiving him and tells him not to trust Chuck. Teddy regroups with
            Chuck and they climb the cliffs toward the lighthouse but become
            separated. Believing he saw Chuck's body on the rocks below, Teddy
            climbs down but finds only a cave where a woman claiming to be the
            real Solando is hiding. She states that she is a former psychiatrist
            who discovered clandestine experiments to develop mind control but
            was forcibly committed. She says that Cawley and Dr. Naehring will
            use Teddy's war trauma to feign a psychotic break, allowing them to
            have him also committed. Teddy returns to the hospital and is
            greeted by Cawley. When Teddy asks about Chuck's whereabouts, Cawley
            firmly insists that Teddy does not have a partner and that he
            arrived on the island alone. Convinced Chuck was taken to the
            lighthouse, Teddy heads there but runs into Naehring, who attempts
            to sedate him. Teddy overpowers him and breaks into the lighthouse,
            only to discover Cawley waiting for him. Teddy confronts Cawley and
            reveals his encounter with Solando, saying he believes Cawley is
            experimenting on him. Cawley denies that Solando ever existed, and
            insists that Teddy has not been drugged, explaining the tremors as
            withdrawals from Chlorpromazine, a neuroleptic medication that Teddy
            has been taking for two years. Chuck arrives and reveals he is in
            fact, Dr. Sheehan. Cawley explains that "Teddy" is Andrew Laeddis, a
            U.S. Marshal incarcerated at Ashecliffe for murdering his manic
            depressive wife after she drowned their three children. Andrew did
            not seek treatment for Dolores when she burned down their apartment
            and instead moved his family to a lake house, where Dolores carried
            out the killings. Cawley explains that Andrew's delusion is a result
            of his guilt, that his migraines and hallucinations are withdrawal
            symptoms, and that he had created the alternate persona of Edward
            Daniels,[a] also a Marshal, who acted violently and espoused
            conspiracy theories about the facility. The "investigation" is an
            elaborate role-play to regain his true persona. Overwhelmed by his
            sudden recall, Andrew faints. Awakening later, Andrew calmly
            recounts the truth, satisfying the doctors that he is lucid. Cawley
            notes that they had achieved this state nine months before, but that
            Andrew had quickly regressed. He warns that this will be Andrew's
            last chance and if he lapses again he will be lobotomized due to his
            very violent conduct towards other patients such as Noyce, and
            towards the guards. Sometime later, Andrew relaxes on the hospital
            grounds with Sheehan. Appearing delusional, Andrew again refers to
            Sheehan as "Chuck" and says they must leave the island. Sheehan
            signals to Cawley, who orders that Andrew be lobotomized. Andrew
            then asks Sheehan if it would be worse "to live as a monster, or to
            die as a good man?" A stunned Sheehan calls Andrew "Teddy" but the
            latter does not respond and leaves peacefully with the orderlies for
            his operation.
