        <h2>Inglourious Basterds</h2>
        <p>
          In 1941, SS-Standartenführer Hans Landa interrogates French farmer
          Perrier LaPadite, suspecting that the LaPadites are hiding a Jewish
          family, the Dreyfuses, under their floorboards. LaPadite confirms this
          to spare his own family, and Landa has the hidden family shot, but
          allows Shosanna Dreyfus to escape.[9] Three years later, U.S. Army
          Lieutenant Aldo Raine recruits Jewish-American soldiers to the
          "Basterds", a black ops commando unit instilling fear among Nazis in
          occupied France by killing and scalping them.

        <h2>Pulp Fiction</h2>
        <p>
          Narrative structure Pulp Fiction's narrative is told out of
          chronological order and follows three main interrelated stories that
          each have a different protagonist: Vincent Vega, a hitman; Butch
          Coolidge, a prizefighter; and Jules Winnfield, Vincent's business
          partner.[9] The film begins with a diner hold-up staged by a couple,
          then begins to shift from one storyline to another before returning to
          the diner for the conclusion. There are seven narrative sequences; the
          three primary storylines are preceded by intertitles: "Prologue – The
          Diner" (i) Prelude to "Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife"
          "Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife" Prelude to "The Gold
          Watch" (a – flashback, b – present) "The Gold Watch" "The Bonnie
          Situation" "Epilogue – The Diner" (ii) If the seven sequences were
          ordered chronologically, they would run: 4a, 2, 6, 1, 7, 3, 4b, 5.

        <h2>Shawshank Redemption</h2>
        <p>
          In early 1947, Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne arrives at
          Shawshank State Prison to serve two consecutive life sentences for
          murdering his wife and her lover. He is befriended by Ellis "Red"
          Redding, a contraband smuggler serving a life sentence, who procures a
          rock hammer and a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Assigned to
          work in the prison laundry, Andy is frequently sexually assaulted by
          prison gang "the Sisters" and their leader, Bogs Diamond. In 1949,
          Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining
          about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him shelter the
          money legally.
