          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and
            directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen King novella
            Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. The film stars Tim Robbins
            as Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank
            State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover, despite
            his claims of innocence. Over the years, Andy befriends fellow
            inmate Ellis "Red" Redding, played by Morgan Freeman, and the two
            form a close bond. The film explores themes of hope, friendship, and
            the indomitable human spirit in the face of adversity.

          <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
          <p>
            In early 1947, Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne arrives at
            Shawshank State Prison to serve two consecutive life sentences for
            murdering his wife and her lover. He is befriended by Ellis "Red"
            Redding, a contraband smuggler serving a life sentence, who procures
            a rock hammer and a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Assigned
            to work in the prison laundry, Andy is frequently sexually assaulted
            by prison gang "the Sisters" and their leader, Bogs Diamond. In
            1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley,
            complaining about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help
            him shelter the money legally. After an assault by the Sisters
            nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats and cripples Bogs, who is
            subsequently transferred to another prison; Andy is not attacked
            again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the
            prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen, a front to
            use Andy's financial expertise to manage financial matters for other
            prison staff, guards from other prisons, and the warden himself.
            Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state legislature
            requesting funds to improve the prison's decrepit library. Brooks is
            paroled in 1954 after serving 50 years, but he cannot adjust to the
            outside world and eventually hangs himself. The legislature sends a
            library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of
            Figaro; Andy plays an excerpt over the public address system and is
            punished with solitary confinement. After his release from solitary,
            Andy explains to a dismissive Red that hope is what gets him through
            his sentence. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for
            public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and
            receiving bribes. Andy launders the money using the alias "Randall
            Stephens". In 1965, Andy and Red befriend Tommy Williams, a young
            prisoner incarcerated for burglary. A year later, Andy helps him
            pass his General Educational Development (GED) exam. Tommy reveals
            to Red and Andy that his cellmate at another prison had claimed
            responsibility for the murders of which Andy was convicted. Andy
            brings the information to Norton who refuses to listen and, when
            Andy mentions the money laundering, sends Andy to solitary
            confinement and has Hadley fatally shoot Tommy under the guise of an
            escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue the money laundering, but
            Norton threatens to destroy the library, remove Andy's protection by
            the guards, and move him to worse conditions. Andy is released from
            solitary confinement after two months, and he tells a skeptical Red
            that he dreams of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican town on the
            Pacific coast. Andy also tells him of a specific hayfield near
            Buxton, asking Red to promise, once he is released, to retrieve a
            package that Andy buried there. Red worries about Andy's mental
            well-being, especially when he learns Andy asked a fellow inmate for
            some rope. At the next day's roll call, the guards find Andy's cell
            empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at a poster of Raquel Welch
            hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with
            his rock hammer over the past 19 years. The previous night, Andy
            used the rope to escape through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe,
            taking Norton's suit, shoes, and ledger, containing evidence of the
            money laundering. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall
            Stephens, withdraws over $370,000[a] of the laundered money from
            several banks, and mails the ledger and other evidence of the
            corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. State
            police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while
            Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest. The following year, Red is
            paroled after serving 40 years but struggles to adapt to life
            outside prison and fears that he never will. Remembering his promise
            to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a
            letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole by
            traveling to Fort Hancock, Texas, and crossing the border into
            Mexico, admitting that he finally feels hope. He finds Andy sanding
            an old boat on a Zihuatanejo beach, and the two reunited friends
            happily embrace.
