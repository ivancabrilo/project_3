          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Pulp Fiction is a 1994 American crime film written and directed by
            Quentin Tarantino from a story he conceived with Roger Avary.[3] It
            tells four intertwining tales of crime and violence in Los Angeles,
            California. The film stars John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce
            Willis, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman. The title refers to
            the pulp magazines and hardboiled crime novels popular during the
            mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy
            dialogue. Tarantino wrote Pulp Fiction in 1992 and 1993,
            incorporating scenes that Avary originally wrote for True Romance
            (1993). Its plot occurs out of chronological order. The film is also
            self-referential from its opening moments, beginning with a title
            card that gives two dictionary definitions of "pulp". Considerable
            screen time is devoted to monologues and casual conversations with
            eclectic dialogue revealing each character's perspectives on several
            subjects, and the film features an ironic combination of humor and
            strong violence.

          <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Narrative structure Pulp Fiction's narrative is told out of
            chronological order and follows three main interrelated stories that
            each have a different protagonist: Vincent Vega, a hitman; Butch
            Coolidge, a prizefighter; and Jules Winnfield, Vincent's business
            partner.[9] The film begins with a diner hold-up staged by a couple,
            then begins to shift from one storyline to another before returning
            to the diner for the conclusion. There are seven narrative
            sequences; the three primary storylines are preceded by intertitles:
            "Prologue – The Diner" (i) Prelude to "Vincent Vega and Marsellus
            Wallace's Wife" "Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife" Prelude
            to "The Gold Watch" (a – flashback, b – present) "The Gold Watch"
            "The Bonnie Situation" "Epilogue – The Diner" (ii) If the seven
            sequences were ordered chronologically, they would run: 4a, 2, 6, 1,
            7, 3, 4b, 5. Sequences 1 and 7 partially overlap and are presented
            from different points of view, as do sequences 2 and 6. According to
            Philip Parker, the structural form is "an episodic narrative with
            circular events adding a beginning and end and allowing references
            to elements of each separate episode to be made throughout the
            narrative".[10] Other analysts describe the structure as a "circular
            narrative".[11][12]

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Hitmen Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega arrive at an apartment to
          retrieve a briefcase for their boss, gangster Marsellus Wallace, from
          a business partner, Brett. After Vincent checks the contents of the
          briefcase, Jules shoots one of Brett's associates. He declaims a
          passage from the Bible, and he and Vincent kill Brett for trying to
          double-cross Marsellus. Another man bursts out of the bathroom and
          fires at them, but every shot misses; after briefly checking
          themselves for wounds, Jules and Vincent shoot him dead. While driving
          away with Brett's associate Marvin, Jules professes that their
          survival was a miracle, which Vincent disputes. Vincent accidentally
          fatally shoots Marvin in the face, and covering Vincent, Jules, and
          the car interior in blood in broad daylight. They hide the car at the
          home of Jules's friend Jimmie, who demands they deal with the problem
          before his wife, Bonnie, comes home. Marsellus sends a cleaner,
          Winston Wolfe, who directs Jules and Vincent to clean the car, hide
          the body in the trunk, dispose of their bloody clothes, and take the
          car to a junkyard. At a diner, Jules tells Vincent that he plans to
          retire from his life of crime, convinced that their "miraculous"
          survival at the apartment was a sign of divine intervention. While
          Vincent is in the bathroom, a couple, "Pumpkin" and "Honey Bunny",
          hold up the restaurant and demand Marsellus's briefcase. Jules
          distracts Pumpkin with its contents, and then overpowers him and holds
          him at gunpoint; Honey Bunny becomes hysterical and points her gun at
          Jules. Vincent returns with his gun aimed at her, but Jules defuses
          the situation. He recites the biblical passage, expresses ambivalence
          about his life of crime, and allows the robbers to take his cash and
          leave. Jules and Vincent leave the diner with the briefcase in hand.
          They take the briefcase to Marsellus and wait while he bribes boxer
          Butch Coolidge to take a dive in his upcoming match. The next day,
          Vincent purchases heroin from his drug dealer, Lance. He shoots up and
          drives to meet Marsellus's trophy wife, Mia, having agreed to escort
          her while Marsellus is out of town. They eat at Jack Rabbit Slim's, a
          1950s-themed restaurant, and participate in a twist contest, then
          return home. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Mia finds his heroin
          and snorts it, mistaking it for cocaine. She suffers an overdose;
          Vincent rushes her to Lance's house, where they revive her with an
          injection of adrenaline into her heart. Vincent drops Mia off at her
          home, and the two agree never to tell Marsellus about the incident.
          Butch bets the bribe money on himself and double-crosses Marsellus,
          winning the bout but accidentally killing his opponent as well.
          Knowing that Marsellus will send hitmen after him, he prepares to flee
          with his girlfriend, Fabienne, but discovers she has forgotten to pack
          a gold watch passed down to him through his family. Returning to his
          apartment to retrieve it, he notices a gun on the kitchen counter and
          hears the toilet flush. When Vincent exits the bathroom, Butch shoots
          him dead and departs. When Marsellus spots Butch stopped at a traffic
          light, Butch rams his car into him, then gets hit by an oncoming
          vehicle, leaving both of them injured and dazed. Once Marsellus
          regains consciousness, he shoots at Butch, chasing him into a
          pawnshop. Butch gains the upper hand and is about to shoot Marsellus,
          but the shop owner, Maynard, captures them at gunpoint and binds and
          gags them in the basement. Maynard and his accomplice Zed take
          Marsellus into another room and begin to rape him, leaving the "gimp"
          – a silent figure in a bondage suit – to watch over Butch. Butch
          breaks loose and knocks the gimp unconscious. Instead of fleeing, he
          decides to save Marsellus, and arms himself with a katana from the
          pawnshop. He kills Maynard and frees Marsellus, who shoots Zed in the
          crotch with Maynard's shotgun. Marsellus informs Butch that they are
          even, and to tell no one about the rape and to depart Los Angeles
          forever. Butch picks up Fabienne on Zed's motorcycle, and they ride
          away.
